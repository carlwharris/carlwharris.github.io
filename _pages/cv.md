## Research experience

### National Institutes of Mental Health

**July 2021 – Present**  
*Postbaccalaureate IRTA*, Machine Learning Team and Data Science & Sharing Team  

* Used machine learning models and kernel regression techniques to predict longitudinal mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic from social, demographic, and behavioral variables.
* Implemented and ran simulations on NIH’s Biowulf HPC cluster to evaluate power and Type I error rate of classical two-sample hypothesis tests in detecting context-dependent changes in longitudinal neural recording data, relative to novel decoding approach based on cross-classification accuracy. 
* Developed system to segment animal motion in video using hidden semi-Markov models with stochastically observable keypoints.


### Tse Laboratory (Octopus Lab)

**May 2019 – June 2021**  
*Undergraduate Researcher*  

* Created MATLAB toolbox for the automated classification of animal behavior in video, using a recurrent neural network classifier trained using features extracted from raw video frames by a convolutional neural. Includes a novel temperature scaling-based confidence measure to refer uncertain classifications for human review and GUI for video annotation.
* Set up lab’s video cameras to continuously record and upload footage to Dropbox, and integrated Dropbox with program running on Dartmouth’s HPC cluster to extract animal position data from more than 25 Tb of video. Implemented multi-object tracker with global nearest-neighbor assignment to segment individual animals’ movement trajectories.
* Used stereo vision and semantic segmentation to reconstruct octopuses’ bodies in 3D. Used non-rigid point cloud registration to model deformations in body contour over time.


### Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory

**March 2019 – June 2021**  
*Undergraduate Researcher*  

* Analyzed rats’ response to reward feedback in reversal learning task in environments with different reward probabilities. Used generalized linear models and novel information theory-based metrics to examine behavioral differences between discrimination and reversal learning. Fit choice behavior to a reinforcement learning model via MLE.
* Applied novel entropy measures to examine trial-by-trial changes in rats’ response to reward feedback in environments with different reward probability.


### 	Dartmouth Economics Department

**September 2018 – January 2020**  
*Research assistant*  

* Responsible for the implementation of an online survey to examine the role of cognitive heuristics and biases on suboptimal annuity choice. Wrote HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to generate questions and record results.
* Managed data from ~3,000 respondents, administered payments from the Dartmouth Economics Department, and created a project website to communicate with respondents.


### Technical skills

* MATLAB, Python, Java
