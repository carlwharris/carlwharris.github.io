<h1 style="font-size:2em;">About</h1>
Current first year student Ph.D. student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Rama Chellappa](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/rama-chellappa/) and [Suchi Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/). At Hopkins, I'm working on AI & healthcare projects centered on multimodal modeling of irregularly-sampled clinical time series data, pre-surgical risk stratification with ECG, and conformal prediction of healthcare outcomes.

<h1 style="font-size:2em;">Prior experience</h1>
Previously, I was a post postbaccalaureate IRTA at the National Institutes of Mental Health, in the [Data Science and Sharing Team](https://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/dsst) and [Machine Learning Team](https://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/mlt). There, I worked on projects related to predicting longitudinal mental health outcomes, detecting context-dependent changes in neural encoding, pose estimation/unsupervised behavior classification, and standardization of neuroscience data. See my [Portfolio](https://carlwharris.github.io/portfolio/) page for details.

<p>I graduated <i>magna cum laude</i> from Dartmouth College in June 2021, with a double major in applied mathematics and neuroscience (high honors) and a minor in economics. I worked on research related to adaptive learning and decision making under uncertainty in <a href="http://ccnl.dartmouth.edu/">Alireza Soltani's lab</a>, and on projects related to animal tracking and behavior classification in <a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/peter/">Peter Tse's octpus lab</a>. I was also on the men's <a href="https://dartmouthsports.com/sports/rowing">Varsity Lightweight Rowing</a> team.</p>
