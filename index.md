Current postbaccalaureate IRTA at the National Institutes of Mental Health, in the [Data Science and Sharing Team](https://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/dsst) and [Machine Learning Team](https://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/mlt), working on:

* Machine learning models for predicting longitudinal mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic
* Detecting context-dependent changes in encoding from longitudinal neural recording activity
* 3D pose estimation & unsupervised classification of animal behavior in video

<p>I graduated <i>magna cum laude</i> from Dartmouth College in June 2021, with a double major in applied mathematics and neuroscience (high honors) and a minor in economics. I worked on research related to adaptive learning and decision making under uncertainty in <a href="http://ccnl.dartmouth.edu/">Alireza Soltani's lab</a>, and on projects related to animal tracking and behavior classification in <a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/peter/">Peter Tse's octpus lab</a>. I was also on the men's <a href="https://dartmouthsports.com/sports/rowing">Varsity Lightweight Rowing</a> team.</p>
