## Education

I graduated *magna cum laude* from Dartmouth College in June 2021, with a double major in applied mathematics and neuroscience (high honors), and a minor in economics. I worked on research related to adaptive learning and decision making under uncertainty in [Alireza Soltani's lab](http://ccnl.dartmouth.edu/), and on projects related to animal tracking and behavior classification in [Peter Tse's octpus lab](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/peter/). I was also on the men's [Varsity Lightweight Rowing](https://dartmouthsports.com/sports/rowing) team.
